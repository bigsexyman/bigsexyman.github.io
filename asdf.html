	<h1>The Baby Shark lyrics are a piece of art.</h1>  
	<p>It starts off with introducing all the characters, the narrators (which later are shown to be in the world of the sharks itself, the narrators become the protagonists).
The narrators introduce a family of sharks, they start off with the youngest and go up, first introducing the ladies and then the men until they get to grandpa shark. The family seems to be a 
usual family with one child, a mother and a father, and two grandparents (that is interesting because there should be four grandparents, we will get to that later).
Once the characters are introduced, the shark family and the narrators go hunting, probably to find some fish and bond. However, it all quickly turns around with the biggest plot twist in the
history of plot twists. The sharks start hunting the narrators as the narrators desperately try to run away and hide. The narrators are finally safe, but in the end we can see
all the sharks right behind them, ready to kill them brutally.</p>

<p><b>My theory is that</b> the sharks symbolise greed in society and the narrators are the middle class. In the first scene you can see all the fishes swimming and an animal that can't swim, but is
riding a bigger fish, we quickly realise that the norm here is that everyone swims. Then we get introduced to the narrators, the narrators seem to have no way of swimming up, which they might
be critisized by the other fish for, thus, nobody cares about them. The narrators instantly start talking about the sharks, which later become the antagonists of this whole storyline. Sharks 
are known for swimming and one more thing that you might have not known.. They are predators, they are known to hunt fish, which means they are on top of the food chain. They seem to be
different very vibrant colours, which suggests that they are rich enough to change their colours (sharks are usually born blue-ish colours). The mother shark can afford to buy lipstick that 
doesn't come off underwater. I am lead to believe that this family of sharks is rich and represents the rich people of the world. When the narrators talk about the sharks, their faces
represent utter fear and nothing else, they are so dead serious when they talk about the sharks, too serious for a kids' song. Once they start hunting the shark family turns on the narrators
in an instant, which shows how desperate the sharks are to get food.. The prices in stores are going up and up and so are the taxes, whilst the sharks are getting more poor by the second.
Going back to what I said about the grandparents being only two, I strongly believe the sharks ate the other two grandparents, as they were too poor to afford to feed so many mouths.
Once the resources ran dry (the grandparents were fully eaten), the family went out to find creatures that can't escape easily and found the narrators, middle class citizens of the water that
can't escape in any way, except running (which would be hard underwater). As the narrators are being chased, you can see many many fish in the background that could easily help the narroators.
However, the fish don't help, either because they are scared to death by the danger of the sharks eating them or because they truly don't care about the non-swimming narrators. Not even 
the fish police try to help out the narrators. I believe it's because the cops in this universe are corrupt and were bribed by the sharks with fish money. The sharks seemed to lose the narrators
but in the end you can see the sharks in the background as I have said before. I believe that the police tipped them off and then the sharks found them. The video cuts short right before the
family pull out their forks, symbolising that they are ready to eat the narrators. However the video cuts short and you don't get to see what happens after, I believe that the sharks
brutally murdered and ate the narrators.</p>
